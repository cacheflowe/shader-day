* Create an easy post-processing filtering situation. Look at the source [here](http://www.airtightinteractive.com/demos/js/uberviz/wordproblems/) for examples of THREE.js processing.
* Get audio data into the demo, easily accessible. Deform some meshes.
* WebMIDI controls to make an actual VJ system from the web.
* Componentize custom objects and services
